This driver for ws2812 led chain is intended to be used in demo applications.
Note that the module is not of end-product quality. 

The ws2812 module assumptions:
- There is only one instance of ws2812 driver, multiple instances are not supported
- Module uses PWM to generate waveform on a signle DOUT pin connected to led chain
